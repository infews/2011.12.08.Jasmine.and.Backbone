# 2011.12.08 Mountain View Meetup

Are you interested in Backbone? Are you test driving your JavaScript?

Jasmine is a BDD/unit testing framework for JavaScript that works just fine with Backbone.js projects.

This presentation has a quick introduction to Jasmine, then gives some tips, tricks, and patterns for using Jasmine with Backbone.

I gave this talk at the <> meetup. Thanks to Ben Curren for the opportunity to speak.

Like all of my talks, this was built using [Keydown](http://github.com/infews/keydown).
